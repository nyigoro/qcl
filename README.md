# Quick Component Language (QCL)
QCL is a modern, component-based markup language designed to address HTMLâ€™s shortcomings, including lack of components, style scoping, interactivity, data binding, concise syntax, i18n, and modularity. It compiles to vanilla HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for universal compatibility.

## Features

### Components: Reusable, encapsulated components with <component>.
### Scoped Styles: Automatic CSS scoping within <style> blocks.
### Interactivity: Built-in <script> for dynamic behavior.
### Data Binding: Two-way and one-way binding with bind: and props.
### Concise Syntax: Simplified tags like <each> for loops.
### i18n: Native translation with lang and t() function.
### Modularity: Import components with <import>.
